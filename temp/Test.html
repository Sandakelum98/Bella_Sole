<p>The majority of Sri Lankans speak Sinhala, with Tamil as the second language. English is
    commonly used by government and tourism officials. Don&#39;t expect everyone, everywhere to be able
    to speak it fluently. It&#39;s much more common in the beach and tourist areas. Most people in rural
    villages cannot speak any English, beyond a few simple words.</p>
